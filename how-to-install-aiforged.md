AIForged Studio can also be installed via our Fastlane releases, offering two installer types:

1. **MSI Installer**: This traditional installer simplifies distribution and management at an enterprise level.
2. **MSIX Installer**: This modern installer packages AIForged Studio and installs it to your local Microsoft Packages directory, similar to apps from the Microsoft Store.

Both installer types from Fastlane include auto-update features to keep AIForged Studio up to date. For more details and to download the installers, please visit the Fastlane page.

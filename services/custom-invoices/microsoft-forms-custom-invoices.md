# Microsoft Forms Custom Invoices

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **Microsoft Form Recognizer - Custom Invoice Service** extends the functionality of [Microsoft Form Recognizer](../custom-forms/microsoft-forms-recognizer.md) to specifically extract information from invoices. Specifically, this service will return the same extracted OCR data in the form of **Key-Value Pairs**, but it returns the **Invoice Line Items** in table format.

This makes the processing of line items much easier, as invoice data such as **Item Codes**, **Descriptions**, **Unit Prices**, **VAT,** and **Netto Amounts** can easily be grouped.

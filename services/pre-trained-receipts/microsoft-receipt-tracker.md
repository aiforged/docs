# Microsoft Receipts

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ​**Microsoft Receipts Service** makes use of pre-trained Invoice models to extract **Key-Value Pairs** of invoice-related data making use of **Microsoft Cognitive Services**. The processing of invoices returns typical information found on invoices, such as **Subtotal, Vat, Total,** and **Date**. **Microsoft Receipts** allows users to categorize and visualize their expenses. Below is an example of a receipt.

The service extracts basic fields that can typically be found on a **Receipt**, such as the **Receipt #**, **Receipt Date**, **Vendor Name**, **Shipping Address Recipient**, and **Purchase Orders**, to name a few. In addition to this, the line items are also extracted.&#x20;

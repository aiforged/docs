# üõ†Ô∏è Utilities

### Overview

AIForged Utility Services are in-house developed tools that augment your agent workflows by providing powerful pre-processing and post-processing automation. These utilities are not intended as standalone services‚Äîinstead, you attach them to core services to clean up, normalize, enrich, route, or validate documents and data at any point in your pipeline.

Attach utility services to parent services as pre- or post-processors to build robust, modular, and highly customizable document workflows.

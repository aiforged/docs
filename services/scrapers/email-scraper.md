# ðŸ“§ Email Scraper

### Overview

The Email Scraper in AIForged is designed to check mailboxes for new emails at scheduled intervals. When new emails are detected, the scraper downloads them into the platform for processing. Attachments are then automatically extracted using the built-in attachment utility, streamlining document intake and workflow automation.

### Prompt-less Code Flow Authentication (Microsoft 365)

AIForged now supports prompt-less code flow for Microsoft 365 mailbox integration, removing the need for any manual user interaction after setup.

* **How it works:**\
  Simply provide your Azure AD Tenant ID and Client ID (from your registered Azure application) in the Email Scraper settings.
* **Setup:**
  1. Register an application in your Azure AD tenant.
  2. Note the **Tenant ID** and **Client ID** from the registration.
  3. Enter these values in the Email Scraper configuration.
* **Operation:**\
  The Email Scraper will authenticate and retrieve a device token automatically during its first scheduled run. From the second scheduled run onward, it will begin retrieving emailsâ€”no user prompts or approvals required.

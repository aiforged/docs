# ðŸ§² Scrapers

Scrapers are specialized components in AIForged designed to automatically fetch documents from a specified location. This process can be configured to happen periodically (on a set schedule) or instantly (as documents arrive). By using scrapers, organizations can seamlessly introduce documents into the AIForged platform, allowing them to immediately enter the processing and automation lifecycle.

> **Tip:** Scrapers are essential for streamlining document intake, reducing manual effort, and ensuring a steady flow of new content into your workflows.

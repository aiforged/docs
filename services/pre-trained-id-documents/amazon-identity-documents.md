# Amazon Identity Documents Extraction

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **Amazon Identity Documents Service** makes use of pre-trained ID doc models to extract **Key-Value Pairs** of invoice-related data making use of **Amazon AnalyzeID API**. The processing of invoices returns relevant information from passports, driver licenses, and other identity documentation issued by the US Government, such as **Name, Surname, ID Number,** and **Date of Birth**.

Key names are standardized within the response. For example, if your driver license says LIC# (license number) and passport says Passport No, **Analyze ID** response will return the standardized key as **Document ID** along with the raw key (e.g. LIC#). This standardization lets customers easily combine information across many IDs that use different terms for the same concept.

## Possible use cases <a href="#possible-use-cases" id="possible-use-cases"></a>

* Extracting invoice-related data.
* Match Name and Surname fields to other supporting docs to verify the identity of a person.

## Add and Process Documents

1. In the **Amazon Identity Documents Service** click on **Inbox** button.
2. Select the Status you want to upload and use Status **None** or **Received** for new documents that have not been processed yet.
3. Select an optional category if you know the category for the document, if you don’t want to select one just click on “No selection”.
4. Find the files on your Local machine and upload them. **The demo's test files can be found at the following link:** [**Click here**](https://larchold-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jannie\_larcai\_com/Ec-\_k8RmUqNAv6WgCgwItfcBTRp1Gk0V6OeyTj2S3SIUQg?e=EquxX9)**.**
5. After all the documents have been uploaded you can check the documents to be processed, click on **Processed Checked** to process the documents.

It is recommended to only process a few documents at a time, especially if it is a new service to properly test if you receive the results you want before processing everything.

## View Processed Documents <a href="#view-processed-documents" id="view-processed-documents"></a>

1. In the **Amazon Identity Documents Service** click on the **Outbox** button.

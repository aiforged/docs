# ðŸ§  Understanding Agents

### Agent Cards

Agent cards in AIForged Studio provide concise summaries of each agent.

They serve as a quick reference of an agent's status, offering essential information about each agent at a glance. They typically include:

* **Project Name**: Clearly identifies the project.
* **Summary Information**: Provides key details such as project description, available balance and relevant metadata about contained services.

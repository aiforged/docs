Matching patterns for **Date** and **Time** can be specified in a list. The **Date/Time Rule Type** will run iterate through all the format entries in the list and try to match one to the data that was extracted. If a pattern was matched, the **DateTime** object can be build by correctly identifying the day (dd), month (MM), year (yyyy) components for **Date**, and hour (HH), minute (mm) and second (ss) compinents for **Time**. Additional formats can be added for both **Date** and **Time** by clicking on "_Click here to add a new row_".

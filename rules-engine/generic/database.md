# Database

The **Database Rule Type** can be applied to any type of extracted data. This rule provides a means to directly interface with any **SQL Database**.

This **Rule Type** is useful when extracted data needs to be synchronized with other external databases, or when external data needs to be pulled into the **Service**.

The following SQL Methods are available:

| SQL Method       | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query            | A SQL query is executed directly on the SQL database.            |
| Stored Procedure | A SQL Stored Procedure is executed directly on the SQL database. |
| Command          | A SQL command is executed directly on the database.              |

The SQL Method can be selected by clicking on the **SQL Method** dropdown box.

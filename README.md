## AIForged (10-04-2024)

### Platform

**User Groups**

* Overhaul: User and user group management has been completely overhauled for the AIForged platform. See the Studio changelog for more information on the overall changes.

**ChatGPT Document Extraction**

* Enhancement: New prompting techniques have been added to allow for structured entity extraction from long form documents such as legal agreements and policy documents.

## AIForged Studio 1.7.0 (10-04-2024)

### Desktop

**User Groups**

* Enhancement: User group management has been completely overhauled.
  * The new hierarchy for user groups is as follows: Project <- User Group <- User Group Role <- User.
  * User permissions are now situated at the role level, where users are linked to a role, a group role is linked to a user group, and a user group is linked to a project.
  * An infinite number of user groups can be linked to a project, an infinite number of group roles can be linked to a group, and so forth.
  * A group role can be assigned multiple permissions. And those permissions will ultimately determine the level of access linked users have to a specific project.
  * The ability for a user to be added to a user group can be restricted by domain.
* Enhancement: The UI and UX have been completely overhauled to reflect this change and to improve the overall user group management experience.

**ChatGPT Document Extraction**

* Prompt editors have been improved to reflect the enhancement to prompting techniques. It is now possible to prompt a model multiple times for the same document text using Sticky prompts and prompt indexes. More information will be added to our documentation in due course.

**AIForged Copilot Preview**

* New Feature: We have worked hard on bringing Copilot functionality to the AIForged Studio. The AIForged Assistant is currently in preview and can be accessed by enabling Teaching Tips in your user profile and clicking on the new Assistant Icon next to the Teaching Tip help icon in any view or tab.
  * The AIForged Assistant is able to guide you through your journey with AIForged and is particularly useful for setting up new projects and services.
  * The AIForged Assistant can also perform certain tasks for you, such as creating, opening and changing Projects and Services and their respective settings. It can even read and summarise information from extracted documents. It has the ability to create and assign work items, or make adjustments to definition rule settings. It can even add, update or read records to and from datasets.
  * Kindly note that the AIForged Assistant is still very much in preview form and any information or assistance it provides may be incomplete, inaccurate or completely irrelevant.

### Desktop

* The contents of the AIForged Studio window will now scale (up to a certain point) to fit the size of the user's desktop. This frees up a lot of screen real estate on devices with smaller or low resolution monitors.
* Users can now view and restore the settings history of any field definition in a service's "All Definitions" view. A new command button "View History" has been introduced for this.
* Users can now view and restore the settings / code history of any custom code. A new "History" tab has been added to the code editor. Please note that at this point in time, restoring code to a previous version will also restore other settings in the containing definition, such as replacement mappings and dictionary lookups.
* A new right-click context menu has been introduced to the document verification view. Right clicking on any blank space in a document will bring up a context menu with the same options available under the "More..." command button.
* It is now possible to copy labels to your clipboard and paste them to any document in any service. New commands have been added for this.
  * Individual labels / tables can be copied by clicking a field and then selecting "Copy Label".
  * All the labels of a document can be copied by utilising the "Copy labels to clipboard" function available in the new right-click context menu, or "More..." command button.
  * Labels can be pasted in one of two ways:
    * "Paste custom labels from clipboard":
      * This will paste the custom labels as is and won't create new definitions. This is useful when copying labels within the same service.
    * "Paste custom labels from clipboard as new":
      * This will paste the custom labels as is and will create new definitions for each label. This is useful when copying labels from one service to another.
* Fixed issue with field value being automatically overriden by an editor's text when simply viewing a field's value.
* Restricted editing a field's value to the text editor in the field value popup.
* Improved the document's value export screen, which can be found in the Inbox, Outbox or Training Box by clicking on the "Export" command button and selecting "Export Screen". Enabling the detailed view will now properly render any tables and allow them to be exported to Excel.
* Improved the Excel export function in the export screen.
* Added Export to CSV to export screen.
* Added Export to JSON to export screen.
* Fixed an issue where label scaling would be incorrect if a document consisted of both portrait and landscape orientated pages.
* Improved the experience when creating custom tables during custom labelling.
* Implemented native search in the documents view, with an optional "Deep Search" function. The "Deep Search" function will search within the extracted values of processed documents. The search can take some time if there are a large number of documents to search through or if the documents have a large number of results.
* New methods to work with tables have been added to the AIForged SDK which are now available in the code editor.
* Attempts at fixing "Access Violation" exception that rarely occurs duing app startup.
* Added functionality to filter log messages in the document process popup.
* Added a search component to the category selection control. This control is used to filter documents in the document view and to select a category during labelling.
* Removed the ability for users to register themselves. It is now necessary for AIForged consultants or partners to register new users.
* It is now possible to transfer custom bundle amounts between projects and services in the user group management screen.
* Added additional details in the transaction view to make it easier to identify services and nested services.
* Users can now restore deleted result documents from the inbox / outbox and wizard analysis / training / definition steps. A new command has been made available for this under the "Actions" menu or may simply be available from the command bar, depending on the view.
* Migrated to a unified codebase that allows us to compile and publish both our desktop and web versions of AIForged Studio with similar features between the two versions.
* Major performance improvements.
* Various bug fixes.

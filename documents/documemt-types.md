# ℹ️ Documemt Types

## Types of documents

It's possible to categorise documents into 3 distinct types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Each type of document comes with its own set of challenges.

### Structured documents

Structured documents generally focus on collecting information in a precise format, guiding the person who is filling them in, with precise fields where each piece of data needs to be entered.

### Semi-structured

Semi-structured documents are documents that do not follow a strict format the way structured forms do and are not bound to specified data fields. These don't have a fixed form but follow a common format. A good example of a semi-structured document is an invoice. Where the layout can differ from vendor to vendor, but the expected information and location of information remains relatively the similar.

#### Unstructured

Unstructured documents are documents in which the information isn't organized according to a clear, structured model and can differ from document to document. A good example of an unstructured document is a contract or policy schedule.

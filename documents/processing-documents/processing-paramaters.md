# Processing Paramaters

## Overview

When processing a document, multiple processing parameters are available that can change the behaviour of the processing.

***

* **Reset Previous Comments**: Clears the comment field in the document's metadata. If disabled, new process comments will be appended to existing ones.
* **Reset Previous Results**: Clears the result field in the document's metadata. If disabled, new process results will be appended to the existing ones.
* **Delete Output of Previous Processing**: Removes all result documents generated by previous processing.
* **Delete Linked Documents**: Deletes all linked (Outbox, Training, etc.) documents associated with the Inbox document.
* **Delete Linked Documents Recursively**: Deletes the entire hierarchy of linked documents.
* **Force Re-Processing**: Forces the document to be fully processed again (default). On some services setting this false will allow the processing to bypass certain pre-processing functions such as document OCR if the document was previously processed.

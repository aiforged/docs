# ðŸ‘¤ Role Member Management

Effectively managing members within roles is crucial for maintaining secure and organized access to your agents and their services in AIForged. Once you have set up your groups and roles, you can assign members to roles to grant them the appropriate access, or remove members to revoke their permissions. This helps you ensure that only the right people have access to your organizationâ€™s AI agents and related services at any given time.

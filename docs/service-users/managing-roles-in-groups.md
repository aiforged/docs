# üìè Managing Roles within Usergroups

Effectively managing roles ensures that users have the appropriate access and responsibilities within your agents. In AIForged, roles are flexible and can be tailored to match your organization‚Äôs unique requirements. See [.](./ "mention") for a further overview of this functionality in AIForged.

### Understanding Roles and Permissions

AIForged supports multiple roles, each granting specific permissions within a project or group. Users can be assigned one or more roles, and custom logic can be applied to further refine their behavior.

**Common Roles**

| **Owner**         | Full, unrestricted access to the agent, including all service configurations and documents.       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Administrator** | Authority to manage and configure the agent, including user management and agent settings.        |
| **Developer**     | Ability to create, modify, and test AI agents and services within the agent.                      |
| **Verify**        | Access to Human In The Loop (HITL) features to manage exceptions and validate business rules.     |
| **Layout**        | Permission to use the document wizard and train documents, enhancing AI learning and performance. |
| **View**          | Read-only access, allowing the user to see agent details without making any changes or edits.     |

!!! tip
    You can assign multiple roles to a single user to combine permissions as needed.

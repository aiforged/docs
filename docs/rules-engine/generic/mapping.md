# Mapping

Similar to the **Dictionary Rule**, the **Mapping Rule** can be applied to any type of extracted data, and is used to automatically map extracted to data to a predefined value. This is especially useful when correcting the extracted data to what is expected.

For example, a **Numeric** value may expected for a field, but the **OCR Service** could return **Alphabetic** characters, such as a 'S' instead of an '5' or a 'O' instead of an '0' (zero). The Mapping Rule is also useful to remove any **Whitespaces** from an extracted OCR value.

The **Replacement Mapping Dictionary** is used to provide a list of values to be mapped. The user is required to provide the **Key** (value to be replaced), and the corresponding mapped value. To add a new entry, click on "_Click here to add a new row"_.

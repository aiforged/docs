# Web API

The **Web API Rule Type** can be applied on any type of extracted data. This **Rule Type** allows the user to specify a **URL endpoint** and build up an **HTTP** request to make a call to an external **Web API**.

This **Rule Type** is useful when extracted data needs to be synchronized with other external systems, or when external data needs to be pulled into the **Service**.

The following properties can be configured to build up the **HTTP** request:

* Web Method (HTTP Get, Put, Post and Delete)
* URL
* Content Type
* HTTP Body
* HTTP Headers

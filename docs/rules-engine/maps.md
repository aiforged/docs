By applying the **Addres Rule Type**, a **Maps Utility** is added to the service. The **Maps Utility** can be configured to use the **Google** or **Azure Maps Engines**, to verify whether a provided address is valid or not. The **Maps Engine** can be selected by clicking on the Maps Engine dropdown box.

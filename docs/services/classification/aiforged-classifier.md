# üß≠ AIForged Classifier

## Overview

The AIForged Classifier is a supervised machine learning service that classifies documents (and pages) into business-ready categories. It is cost‚Äëeffective, reliable, and typically requires minimal maintenance over an agent‚Äôs lifetime. Use it to route work, branch flows, and organize documents for downstream processing.

!!! info
    Ideal for document triage, inbox routing, automated foldering, and pre‚Äëprocessing before specialized extraction.

---

## Supported content types

- PDF (single or multi‚Äëpage)
- TIFF (single or multi‚Äëpage)
- Images: JPEG, PNG

!!! info
    If your inputs are in other formats, normalize with the AIForged PDF Converter first for best results.

---

## Possible use cases

- Auto‚Äëseparate invoices, receipts, and statements for downstream extractors.
- Triage HR or onboarding documents (ID, proof‚Äëof‚Äëaddress, contracts).
- Identify mixed batches and route to the right Service per category.
- Page‚Äëlevel classification to split/assemble documents before export.

!!! tip
    If accuracy drops on scanned or layered PDFs, try enabling Force PDF Image. It increases processing time but often improves consistency.

## Training the classifier

1. Define classes (Categories)
    - In the Categories step, add each business category you need (e.g., Invoice, Receipt).
    - Aim for clear, distinct definitions to avoid overlap.
    - ![](../../assets/image%20(10)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1).png)

2. Prepare and upload training data
    - Go to the Training step and upload example documents per class.
    - Provide at least 5‚Äì10 representative samples per class to start; more is better.
    - Upload one class at a time to avoid labeling mistakes.
    - ![](../../assets/image%20(11)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1).png)

3. Train the model
    - Click the Train ![](../../assets/image%20(13)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1).png) button.
    - ![](../../assets/image%20(12)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1).png)
    - Keep processing parameters default for the first run.
    - Monitor progress; the dialog will close automatically when finished.

!!! info
    Balanced, diverse samples per class lead to better generalization. Add new examples over time and retrain to improve accuracy.

## Add and process documents

1. Open Service
    - In the AIForged Classifier, click Upload or drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop files into the grid.

2. Select Category (optional)
    - For unlabeled production items, leave as ‚ÄúNo selection.‚Äù
    - For additional training or test labeling, choose the intended Category.

3. Process documents
    - Select items, click Process or Process Checked.
    - For clean re‚Äëruns, consider enabling Reset Previous Results and Delete Output of Previous Processing.

!!! tip
    For new configurations, process a small batch first to validate predictions before you scale up.

---

## View processed documents

- Switch the usage filter to Outbox to view results.
- Open a processed item to see:
    - Predicted category and confidence
    - Page‚Äëlevel vs document‚Äëlevel classification outcome
    - Any grouped output (if Merge To PDF is enabled)
- Use filters to review low‚Äëconfidence predictions and feed corrections back into training.

---

## Troubleshooting tips

- Classifier not performing well
    - Ensure at least 5‚Äì10 varied examples per class; add more for edge cases.
    - Avoid near‚Äëduplicate samples across different classes.
    - Check if classes are too similar; consider merging or adding clearer examples.

- Training fails to start/complete
    - Verify sufficient credits on the agent.
    - Confirm formats are supported (PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG).
    - Re‚Äëupload any files that errored during upload.

- Unexpected page/document grouping
    - Review Merge To PDF setting.
    - For page‚Äëlevel flows, keep Merge To PDF off and manage assembly downstream.

- Many low‚Äëconfidence results
    - Add representative samples and retrain.
    - Consider pre‚Äëprocessing (Digitizer, PDF Converter) to normalize inputs.

- Performance concerns
    - Use Auto Execution with moderate Batch Size (e.g., 10‚Äì30) and a sensible interval.
    - Avoid Force PDF Image unless needed; it increases processing time.

## Best practices

- Balance your classes
    - Keep similar numbers of samples per class to avoid bias.
- Keep classes distinct
    - Use clear naming and scope; split overly broad classes.
- Iterate regularly
    - Add misclassified samples to training and retrain periodically.
- Normalize early
    - Convert to PDF and standardize scans for consistent results.
- Govern with categories
    - Use Categories for business types; Usage/Status for lifecycle (Inbox, Processing, Verification, Outbox).

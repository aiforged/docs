# Microsoft Custom Text Classification

### Overview

The Microsoft Custom Text Classification Service in AIForged leverages Azure Cognitive Services for Language to enable powerful, custom document classification. This cloud-based API allows you to train machine learning models on your own labeled data, providing flexibility and high accuracy for text classification tasks.

{% hint style="info" %}
This service is ideal for organizations with unique document types, custom workflows, or specific classification needs that arenâ€™t addressed by out-of-the-box models.
{% endhint %}

***

### How It Works

* **Custom Model Training:**\
  Users upload their own labeled documents to train the model. Each document must be tagged with the correct class or category.
* **Flexible Data Split:**\
  You can specify the percentage of documents used for training versus evaluation (recommended: 80% training, 20% testing).
* **Dependent OCR Service:**\
  An OCR service is automatically created alongside this classification service to extract text from documents before classification. Default OCR settings are usually sufficient, but can be adjusted if needed.

***

### Possible Use Cases

* Distinguishing between different types or variants of similar documents.
* Automating email or ticket triage.
* Custom document routing based on content.

***

### Supported Content Types

* PDF
* Word or Excel documents
* Images
* Text files

{% hint style="info" %}
If your content is in a different format, use the AIForged PDF Converter as a pre-processor to generate a compatible file for classification.
{% endhint %}

### Best Practices

* **Upload at Least 50 Documents per Category:**\
  For best results, upload a minimum of 50 labeled documents for each category you want to train.
* **Use Clear and Consistent Labels:**\
  Ensure each document is accurately tagged with its intended category.
* **Recommended Data Split:**\
  Use 80% of your data for training and 20% for evaluation to minimize overfitting and improve model performance.
* **Diverse Examples:**\
  Include a variety of real-world examples for each category to help the model generalize.

### Service Setup

Follow these steps to add and configure the Microsoft Custom Text Classification Service to your agent:

1. **Open the Agent View**\
   Navigate to the agent where you want to add the classification service.
2. **Add the Classification Service**\
   Click the **Add Service** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (1).png>) button.
3. **Select Service Type**\
   Choose **Microsoft Custom Text Classifier Service** from the available service types.\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (1).png>)
4. **Configure the Service Wizard**\
   Open the Service Configuration Wizard.\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (1).png>)  or  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (1).png>)
   * **Step 1: General Settings**\
     Configure the core settings. Default settings are sufficient for most use cases.
     * Set the **Training/Testing Split Percentage** as desired (default: 80% training, 20% testing).\
       ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (34) (1).png>)
   * **Step 2: Define Categories**\
     Add user-defined categories for your classification task.\
     ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)
   *   **Step 3: Upload Training Documents**\
       ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

       1. Click the **Upload** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>) button or drag and drop files over the documents grid.\
          ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)
       2. Select the user-defined category for your uploads.
       3. Upload files for each category (recommended: at least 50 documents per category).
       4. Once all files are uploaded, review your settings.
       5. Click the **Train** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>) button.
       6. In the dialog window, click **Process** (leave all settings as default).
       7. The training progress dialog will appear and close automatically when finished.

       > **Tip:** Training duration depends on the number of files uploaded.
   * **Step 4: Definition Document**\
     After training, a definition document will be created automatically.
   * **Step 5: Dependent OCR Service**\
     The service configuration page for the dependent OCR service will open.
     * Choose the appropriate OCR engine (Tesseract, Microsoft, or Google) if you need to adjust settings.
     * For most use cases, default settings are sufficient.

### Adding and Processing Documents

1. **Open Service**\
   In your Microsoft Custom Text Classification Service, click the **Upload** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>) button or drag and drop files over the document grid.\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)
2. **Select Category (Optional)**\
   If known, select the document category. Otherwise, click on **No category**.
3. **Process Documents**\
   After uploading, select the documents to process and click the **Process** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png>) button.

> **Tip:** For new services, process a small batch first to verify results before processing everything.

### Troubleshooting Tips

* **Model Accuracy Is Low:**
  * Ensure you have uploaded enough labeled documents per category (at least 50).
  * Double-check that labels are accurate and unambiguous.
  * Increase data diversity by including a variety of document types for each category.
* **Training Fails or Is Slow:**
  * Make sure your files are in a supported format (PDF, Word, Excel, Image, or Text).
  * Check for upload errors or corrupted documents.
  * Large datasets may take longer; monitor the progress dialog for updates.
* **OCR Issues:**
  * If text extraction is poor, try a different OCR engine or adjust OCR settings.
  * Use clear, high-quality source documents for best OCR accuracy.

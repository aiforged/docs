  * Make sure your receipts display line items in a standard table or itemized list format.
  * Handwritten or highly stylized receipts may affect extraction accuracy.
* **Upload or Processing Errors?**
  * Try re-uploading the document or using a different sample to rule out file-specific issues.
  * If errors persist, check your agent's service configuration or contact support for assistance.
* **Performance Issues?**
  * Processing large batches may take longer. Start with smaller batches to ensure service responsiveness.

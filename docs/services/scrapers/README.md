# üóÇÔ∏è Scrapers

### Overview

Scrapers are specialized components in AIForged designed to automatically fetch documents from a specified location. This process can be configured to happen periodically (on a set schedule) or instantly (as documents arrive). By using scrapers, organizations can seamlessly introduce documents into the AIForged platform, allowing them to immediately enter the processing and automation lifecycle.

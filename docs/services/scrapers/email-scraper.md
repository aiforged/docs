***

### Supported Platforms

- **Gmail**

    - Any IMAP‚Äëcapable provider can be used with the correct settings.

***

### Possible Use Cases

* Automated intake of emailed documents (invoices, statements, forms) and attachment extraction.
* Separate scrapers per supplier, department, or folder for organized processing.
* Build hands‚Äëoff ‚Äúemail to workflow‚Äù pipelines across multiple tenants or mailboxes.

### Prompt-less Code Flow Authentication (Microsoft 365)

AIForged supports prompt‚Äëless device code flow for Microsoft 365. After initial setup, no user interaction is required on scheduled runs.

- How it works
    - Provide your Azure AD Tenant ID and Client ID (from your Azure app registration) in the Email Scraper settings.
- Setup
    1. Register an application in your Azure AD tenant.
    2. Note the Tenant ID and Client ID.
    3. Enter both values in the Email Scraper configuration and enable Prompt‚Äëless Code Flow.

- Operation
    - The scraper retrieves a device token automatically on its first scheduled run. On subsequent runs, it retrieves emails without prompts.

!!! info
    This is the recommended and most secure way to connect Microsoft 365 mailboxes‚Äîno stored passwords and no manual prompts after setup.

### Service Configuration Settings

Apply the following settings depending on your email provider. Values not listed can typically be left as defaults.

#### Microsoft 365 (Recommended)

* Service Type: IMAP
* Server: outlook.office365.com
* Port: 993
* Username: The email address to be scraped
* Password: Not required when using prompt‚Äëless code flow
* Prompt‚Äëless Code Flow: Yes (enable this option)
* Tenant ID: Your Azure AD tenant ID
* Client ID: Your Azure app registration client ID
* Remove XOAUTH2: No
* Folder: The mailbox folder to monitor (e.g., Inbox)
* Processed Folder: The folder where processed emails will be moved

#### Gmail

* Service Type: IMAP
* Server: imap.gmail.com
* Port: 993
* Username: The email address to be scraped
* Password: App‚Äëspecific password (required by Google for third‚Äëparty IMAP access)
* Remove XOAUTH2: Yes
* Folder: The mailbox folder to monitor (e.g., Inbox)
* Processed Folder: The folder where processed emails will be moved

#### Other Providers

* Service Type: IMAP
* Server: Provider‚Äëspecific IMAP server address
* Port: Typically 993
* Username: The email address to be scraped
* Password: Email account or app‚Äëspecific password (as required)
* Remove XOAUTH2: As required by your provider
* Folder: The mailbox folder to monitor
* Processed Folder: The folder where processed emails will be moved

### Enable Auto Execution

Turn on Auto Execution to run the scraper at scheduled intervals. Adjust the interval based on expected mail volume and provider throttling.

***

### View Imported Emails and Attachments

* Open the Email Scraper service to see newly retrieved emails in the grid.
* Open an email to review headers and extraction details.
* Attachments are automatically extracted and available as documents for downstream processing by other services in your agent.

***

### Known Limitations

* Provider throttling and rate limits
    * IMAP providers (including Microsoft 365 and Gmail) may throttle frequent polling or large mailbox operations.
* Authentication constraints
    * Gmail requires app‚Äëspecific passwords for IMAP access.
    * Microsoft 365 requires a correctly configured Azure app (Tenant ID and Client ID) for prompt‚Äëless device code flow.
    * Some providers may block basic authentication or require modern auth; ensure ‚ÄúRemove XOAUTH2‚Äù is set appropriately.
* Mailbox and folder permissions
    * The configured account must have permission to read and move messages in the monitored and processed folders (shared mailboxes may need explicit permissions).
* Duplicate processing risk
    * If ‚ÄúProcessed Folder‚Äù is not set or moving messages fails, messages may be re‚Äëseen on the next run.
* Large or unusual attachments
    * Very large attachments or unusual MIME structures may increase processing time or be skipped by the provider.
* HTML‚Äëonly or malformed emails
    * Some messages may contain only HTML or malformed headers that reduce metadata extraction quality.

!!! info
    Tip: For large mailboxes, start with a narrow Folder scope and use a dedicated Processed Folder to avoid re‚Äëprocessing and to keep runs fast.

***

### Troubleshooting Tips

* Not retrieving any emails?
    * Verify IMAP is enabled for the mailbox, and confirm server/port/SSL settings.
    * Check credentials or app configuration (Gmail app password, M365 Tenant ID/Client ID with prompt‚Äëless code flow enabled).
    * Ensure Folder names are correct (case‚Äësensitive on some providers).
* Emails re‚Äëprocessing repeatedly
    * Confirm the Processed Folder exists and that the scraper can move messages after extraction.
    * Check mailbox rules or retention policies that might move items back into the monitored folder.
* Authentication failures
    * Gmail: Use an app‚Äëspecific password and enable IMAP in account settings.
    * Microsoft 365: Confirm the Azure app registration, Tenant ID, Client ID, and permissions. Retry after enabling prompt‚Äëless code flow.
* Attachments not extracted
    * Verify the message actually contains attachments (some links are not attachments).
    * Check attachment size limits and MIME structure; re‚Äësend a test email with a standard PDF.
* Slow runs or timeouts
    * Reduce polling frequency or limit to a smaller Folder.
    * Archive old emails from the monitored folder to improve performance.

***

### Best Practices

* Use Microsoft 365 prompt‚Äëless device code flow for secure, hands‚Äëoff integration.
* For Gmail, always use app‚Äëspecific passwords and enable IMAP in account settings.
* Configure a dedicated Processed Folder to prevent duplicates and keep the Inbox tidy.
* Consider separate scrapers per mailbox or per folder to isolate workflows and simplify troubleshooting.
* Start with a small interval and scale up cautiously, monitoring provider throttling and mailbox size.

### FAQ

* Do I need to store passwords?
    * For Microsoft 365 with prompt‚Äëless device code flow, no passwords are stored. For Gmail and other providers, use app‚Äëspecific or provider‚Äëapproved credentials.
* Can I scrape shared mailboxes in Microsoft 365?
    * Yes, provided the configured account has permission to access the shared mailbox and folders.
* How do I prevent duplicate processing?
    * Set a Processed Folder and ensure the scraper can move messages after processing.
* Are attachments always extracted?
    * Standard attachments are extracted automatically. Extremely large or unusual MIME formats may require a test or an alternative intake path.
* Can I run multiple scrapers in one agent?
    * Yes. Use separate scrapers for different mailboxes or folders to keep workflows organized and scalable.

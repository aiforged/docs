# Dataset

The Dataset activities in the AIForged UiPath Activities provides a comprehensive suite of activities designed to manage and manipulate custom datasets within your automation workflows. These activities enable seamless integration with the AIForged platform, allowing users to create, update, retrieve, and synchronize datasets efficiently.

* **Integration**: The dataset activities are tightly integrated with the AIForged platform, facilitating smooth interactions with project and service datasets. This integration ensures that users can leverage the full capabilities of AIForgedâ€™s data handling features within their UiPath automation projects.
* **Customization**: Users have the flexibility to tailor dataset operations according to their specific needs. With options to filter data, specify pagination, and include additional information such as verifications, the activities support a wide range of data management scenarios.
* **Data Integrity**: The activities are designed to maintain data integrity across operations, ensuring that datasets are accurately created, updated, or deleted as per user actions. This guarantees that the data remains consistent and reliable throughout its lifecycle.
* **Performance Considerations**: Handling large datasets can impact performance, so these activities include options like pagination and selective data inclusion to optimize processing times and resource usage. Users can configure these options to balance performance with data retrieval needs effectively.

By utilizing the dataset activities, users can enhance their automation workflows with robust data management capabilities, driving more informed decision-making and efficient operations.

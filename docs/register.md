# ✏️ Register

## Overview

AIForged does not offer self-service sign-up. To ensure security, correct Tenant setup, and proper role assignments, registration follows one of two paths:

- New companies: contact the AIForged Sales team to start onboarding.
- Existing companies: request an account via your AIForged Tenant administrator or your AIForged consultant.

!!! warning
    Self-registration is disabled. Accounts must be created and linked to the correct company Tenant by an authorized administrator or by AIForged during onboarding.

!!! tip
    Not sure which path applies to you? If your company already uses AIForged, use “Existing companies.” If you’re evaluating AIForged for the first time, use “New companies.”

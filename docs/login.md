## Sign in with an External Account (SSO)

AIForged supports sign‚Äëin with external identity providers. You can log in directly with a provider or link a provider to an existing AIForged account.

Supported providers

- Microsoft
- Facebook
- Google
- Twitter
- GitHub
- LinkedIn
- Azure Active Directory (via Microsoft)

First‚Äëtime use (no existing AIForged account)
- If you haven‚Äôt registered or logged in before, signing in with an external account will create an AIForged account using publicly available profile details from the provider.

Existing users (link and use SSO)
- Link an external account to your existing AIForged account in your User Profile. Once linked, you can log in using either your AIForged credentials or the external provider.

### Link an external account (recommended before using SSO)

1. Open your profile
    - In Studio, go to User menu ‚Üí [User Profile](user-profile.md)

2. Link a provider
    - Find the External Accounts section and select a provider (e.g., Microsoft, Google).
    - Complete the provider‚Äôs consent screen.

3. Confirm the link
    - Your provider is now associated with your AIForged account.

4. Use SSO next time
    - On the login screen, choose your linked provider to sign in.

!!! info
    Linking SSO ensures your work stays tied to your existing AIForged account, preserving roles, access, and history.

## Select the correct Tenant

Most users belong to:

- A personal Tenant (created with your account), and
- Your company‚Äôs Tenant (added by your company admin).

After login:

- Use the Tenant selector in the top‚Äëright of Studio.
- Switch to your company‚Äôs Tenant before creating agents or configuring services.

!!! warning
    Working in the wrong Tenant can lead to missing permissions, hidden projects, or disabled actions. If something seems unavailable, check your Tenant first.

## Security best practices

- Enable and use MFA for all user accounts.
- Prefer SSO with your organization‚Äôs identity provider where available.
- Sign out from shared machines and close your browser when done.
- Review your linked external accounts regularly in your profile.

## Troubleshooting

- I can‚Äôt log in
    - Verify your internet connection.
    - Confirm you‚Äôre using the correct environment (https://studio.aiforged.com vs any internal/beta URLs).
    - If you deployed AIForged on‚Äëpremises, use your internal Studio URL.
- Network access issues (enterprise networks)
    - Ask your network admin to allow outbound access to your AIForged Service Endpoint URL (visible in Studio ‚Üí Settings).
- I forgot my password
    - Use [Forgot Password](forgot-password.md) to reset.
- MFA problems
    - Ensure your device time is set to automatic and in sync; then retry.
    - If still blocked, contact your Tenant administrator to reset MFA.
- I can sign in but can‚Äôt see my team‚Äôs agents/services
    - Switch to your company‚Äôs Tenant using the top‚Äëright selector.
    - Confirm your role (Owner, Administrator, Developer) with your admin.
- External login fails
    - Make sure the external account is linked in your profile.
    - If you manage multiple work/personal identities, confirm you selected the intended account at the provider‚Äôs prompt.

    - Try a different browser or clear cache; then retry.
    - Contact your AIForged administrator or consultant for assistance.

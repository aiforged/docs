# ‚è© Understanding Document Flows

### Document flow in a service

Each service has an **Inbox** and an **Outbox**. A physical document is passed into the inbox, and the service processes it to produce a result in the outbox

    Note that services might often produce different outputs, for example: an Extractor may produce document field results, whereas Classifiers might produce document groups

### Hiarcial Flow

Documents are connected hierarchically. We can track documents both through a single service and between multiple services using a Master Id to Id mapping.

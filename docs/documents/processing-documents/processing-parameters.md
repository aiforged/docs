| Parameter                         | Description (when enabled)                                                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reset Previous Comments           | Clears the Comment field in the document’s metadata before processing.                                                        | If disabled, new process comments are appended to existing ones.                                       |
| Reset Previous Results            | Clears the Result field in the document’s metadata before processing.                                                         | If disabled, new process results are appended to existing ones.                                        |
| Delete Output of Previous Processing | Removes all Result documents generated by previous processing.                                                               | Useful to avoid stale outputs when re‑running a flow.                                                  |
| Delete Linked Documents           | Deletes all linked documents (e.g., Outbox, Training) associated with the Inbox document.                                     | Does not traverse the full hierarchy; use “Delete Linked Documents Recursively” for deep deletion.    |
| Delete Linked Documents Recursively | Deletes the entire hierarchy of linked documents.                                                                            | Use with care—this will remove all downstream linked items.                                            |
| Force Re‑Processing               | Forces the document to be fully processed again.                                                                              | Default: enabled. If disabled on some services, pre‑processing (e.g., OCR) may be reused/skipped.     |

# ðŸ’¡ Agents

### Overview

Agents in AIForged are containers for [AI services](../services//index.md), and are essential for user access management. An agent can encapsulate an entire solution, and there is no limit to the amount of AI services that can be present in an agent.

### Creating an agent

Creating an agent in AIForged Studio is a straightforward process:

* **From the home view click on the** ![](../assets/image%20%2845%29%20%281%29.png) **(Create a new agent) button.** ![](../assets/image%20%2848%29%20%281%29.png)
* **Select an optional starting service**:
  You can opt to create your new agent with or without an intial AI service.
  *   To create a blank agent (no initial service) click on the **Create blank agent** button in the dialog:

  *   Alternatively, you can select an initial service type to start with, for example, an **LLM Extractor** under the **Extract & Verify** group of AI services, and then click on **Create**.

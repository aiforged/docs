# Custom Datasets

**AIForged** provides a means for users to create **Custom Datasets** within the project implementation. The user is allowed to create the **Custom Dataset** as a standalone entity, which can be affiliated with multiple services within a **Project**. Custom Datasets are typically used with the following scenarios:

* To create a rolled-up collection of data that can easily be exported.
* A look-up table between various fields.
* When structured data needs to be shared between multiple **Services**.

A user can manage **Custom Datasets** either via the **AIForged Studio**, or by a [Custom Code](../../custom-service-code/basemodule/custom-dataset-related-methods.md) implementation.
